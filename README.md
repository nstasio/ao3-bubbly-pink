Pink site skin for https://archiveofourown.org/.

## How to use
Copy the CSS, go to your skins, create a new skin, and paste the CSS in.  Name it, and under advanced options set @ media to screen.
Also under advanced settings, you can chain in any skins you want with parent skins.  For instance, if you use a user skin to hide certain works from your searches, you can parent it so that it still works.
